<p align="left">This repository contains a notepad in which texts can be assigned to different categories with different priorities. Notes can be added or deleted completely. LocalStorage was used for the first time in this project.<br><br> 

This project is part of the Developer Akademie's software developer training program to learn more about JavaScript. I developed the design for this notepad, ensuring that it met the technical and logical requirements set out by the Developer Akademie.
